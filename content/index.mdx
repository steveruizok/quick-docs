# Introduction

Welcome to QuickDocs, a pop-up static site for documenting your things.

## Installation

To use QuickDocs:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Open a new folder
   [in your terminal app](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/open-command-window-terminal-window-specific-folder-windows-mac-linux/).
3. Run `npx create-quick-docs`.
4. Follow the instructions in the terminal.

By default, this process will create your QuickDocs project in a new folder
named `docs`. If you'd like your folder to be named something else, add the name
like this:

```
npx create-quick-docs myDocs
```

Once installed, you can jump straight to editing, developing and publishing your
docs.

## Your project folder

Let's take a tour of the project folder.

### Content

```js
├── content/ // highlight-line
│   ├─ docs/
│   ├─ nav/
│   ├─ assets/
│   └─ index.mdx
└── src/
```

The **content** folder contains all of your projects's content. Any
[Markdown React](https://mdxjs.com/) files (`.mdx`) will be automatically
converted into pages like this one. The page's URL will be determined by its
path relative to the content folder.

| Path                       | URL                                    |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `/content/index.mdx`       | `http://www.your-site.com`             |
| `/content/about.mdx`       | `http://www.your-site.com/about`       |
| `/content/docs/index.mdx`  | `http://www.your-site.com/docs`        |
| `/content/docs/button.mdx` | `http://www.your-site.com/docs/button` |

Your project's navigation areas (header, sidebar, and footer) will pull content
from the files contained in the **content/nav** folder.

| File                       | Role            |
| -------------------------- | --------------- |
| `/content/nav/header.mdx`  | Header content  |
| `/content/nav/sidebar.mdx` | Sidebar content |
| `/content/nav/footer.mdx`  | Footer content  |

> The sidebar's links are _not_ automatically generated. If you add a new page
> to your project, you'll need to open `sidebar.mdx` and add a link to that
> page.

As with all `.mdx` files, you are free to include React components alongside
standard Markdown. While you can `import` these components directly into the
file, you may also use **shortcodes** as described in the next section.

| File                       | Notes                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `/content/docs/button.mdx` | Imports a component directly.   |
| `/content/nav/header.mdx`  | Uses shortcodes for components. |

### Source

```js
├── content/
└── src/      // highlight-line
    ├─ components/
    ├─ templates/
    ├─ index.js
    └─ theme.js
```

The **src** folder contains the rest of the projects's source code. If you want
to change how the site looks, works or behaves, you can make those changes here.

This project uses a development that that includes:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/)

The easiest place to start would be `theme.js`, which defines the site's theme
using the [System UI Theme Specification](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec).

To create **shortcodes** for React components that you'd like to use in your
`.mdx` files, add these components to the `src/components.js` file.
[Click here](https://mdxjs.com/blog/shortcodes/) for more information on
shortcodes.

## Editing

For editing, I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
(or VSCode).

1. Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. In the VSCode menu, select **File > Open** and select your project's folder.
3. To get help editing your `.mdx` files, install the
   [MDX plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=silvenon.mdx).
4. Edit or add `.mdx` files in your projects `content` folder.

To see your changes live in the browser, you can start the project on a local
development server. With the project folder open in VSCode:

1. Open the integrated terminal by selecting **View > Terminal**.
2. In the terminal, type `npm start` and press Enter.
3. Wait for the start-up process to complete.
4. Visit the server's local URL in your browser – most likely this is
   `http://localhost:8000/`.

While the server is running, saving a changed file will update that part of your
project.

To stop the local server, press `control + c` in the terminal. You can also stop
the server by closing your VSCode window.

## Publishing

To publish this project on the web, run `npm run build` in the terminal. This
will create a production-ready website in your project's `public` folder. You
have many ways to host this website, but here's one:

1. Run `npm run build` to create your `public` folder.
2. Open your browser and visit [Netlify Drop](http://netlify.com/drop).
3. Open your project folder in Finder.
4. Drag the entire `public` folder onto the Netlify Drop page.

This will create a hosted version of your project. (The URL will be random,
though you can change it under Site Settings.) You can read more about hosting
on Netlify [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/hosting-on-netlify/).
